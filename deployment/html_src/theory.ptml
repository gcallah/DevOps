                Deployment pipeline is an integral part of Devops toolchain, 
                enabling best practices like continuous integration and 
                continuous delivery.
                <ul class="nested">
                <li>Continuous integration is a practice to continuously 
                integrate and build the code.</li>
                <li>Continuous delivery means building the code, deploying to 
                another environment and testing the code to make it ready for 
                deploying to the production environment.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                Automation is a crucial aspect of Deployment pipeline and can 
                be achieved using Jenkins pipeline and tools like puppet, 
                chef or ansible which can turn infrastructure into code. To 
                quote Paul Venezia: “Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt were all
                built with that very goal in mind: to make it much easier to 
                configure and maintain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of 
                servers.”

                <blockquote>
                "The enabling idea of Infrastructure as Code is that the
                systems and devices used to run software can be treated as
                if they, themselves, are software." -- Kief Morris

                <p>
                Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a mechanism to make the 
                infrastructure reliable, repeatable and fast by writing code 
                for configuring environments and automating the provisioning 
                of infrastructure.

                    Goals
                </h4>

                <ol class="nested">
                    <li>Infrastructure should never be resistant to changes, 
                    which should be made in a regular and automated fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repetitive tasks should done via automation.</li>
                    <li>Spinning up new environments should be self service.
                    </li>
                    <li>Focus should be on failure recovery rather than 
                    failure avoidance.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Benefits
                </h4>

                <ol class="nested">
                <li> It helps delivering stable environments rapidly and 
                scalably.
                </li>
                <li> Since the desired state of the environment is 
                represented by code, no manual configuration is required.
                </li>
                <li> As opposed to manual provisioning, which are harder to 
                debug because of different configurations and imprecise 
                instructions, IaC makes servers more consistent, as their 
                configuration is defined using code.
                </li>
