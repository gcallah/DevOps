            Our Evaluation of GoCD
        </h1>

        <p>
            GoCD is an open source tool used in software development to
            achieve continuous delivery (CD) of software. It supports
            automating the entire build-test-release process from code check-in
            to deployment. It helps to keep producing valuable software in
            short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably released
            at any time.
            GoCD was originally developed at ThoughtWorks Studios in 2007 and
            released as open source in 2014.

        <ul>

            <li>
            GoCD can easily model and visualize complex workflows. It is
            suitable for single purpose, focused tool.
            </li>
            <li>
            GoCD can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and
            on-demand deployment. Its fan-in/fan-out dependency management
            ensures that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream
            pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor
            pipeline or material.
            </li>
            <li>
            GoCD compare both files and commit messages across any two
            arbitrary builds, making it easy to troubleshoot a broken pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
            GoCD provides parallel execution across pipelines, platforms,
            versions, branches, etc. and helps eliminate bottlenecks.
                   </li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Now for some things that are not so good with GoCD:</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>
            GoCD is built specifically with CD in mind as compared to Jenkins
            and Travis that are built for CI. This is a huge factor since we
            are looking for CI at this stage.
            </li>

            <li>
            It uses a bit more memory than Jenkins which can be a problem if it
            runs on Windows VM.
            </li>

            <li>
            Almost all operations are shell based, as compared to GUI support
            through Jenkins and travis plugins
            </li>

            <li>
            GoCD does not have a large plugin ecosystem and there are very few
            documented integrations
            </li>

            <li>
            GoCD's community is only 1000 members strong as it is relatively
            new. It hasn't been used by many companies yet and documentation is
            comparitively less. This means there is still a great scope for
            development and newer versions.
