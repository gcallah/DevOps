                Our Evaluation of Jenkins
            </h1>

            <p>
                Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java which
                supports continuous integration. The <strong>Hudson</strong> project
                was the precursor to Jenkins which was orignally started by Sun
                Microsystems, after the acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle,
                <strong>Jenkins</strong> was forked from Hudson and its
                independent community was formed. After this, Jenkins has became the most popular automation tool in
                software industries.

            <h4> Simple workflow of how Jenkins works </h4>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li> Developers change their source code. </li>
                <li> Jenkins picks up the changed source code and triggers a
                     build that runs any tests that are required.</li>
                <li> The build output is available on the Jenkins dashboard.
                     Automatic notifications can be sent to user regarding code
                     status. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Why Jenkins is better than Continuous Integration tools</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Jenkins is widespread.</li>
            	<li>It is interconnected very well with over a 1000 
            	plug-ins that allow easy integration with development, 
            	testing and deployment tools.
            	</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why Jenkins is good?</h4>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li> Jenkins is an automation tool that spans the entire development cycle from Building to Deployment. </li>
                <li> Jenkins has over 1400 plugins which helps it to integrate with any other tool across different platforms and framework. </li>
                <li> It has a master-slave architechture and allows us to create nodes depending on the task in hand i.e., you can create different Jenkins node to handle tasks
                     such as build, delpoy, test etc. </li>
                <li> Jenkins supports git and many other version control systems.</li>
                <li> It is most active automation server tool installed in the software industry and is estimated to have more than 1 million users.</li>
                <li> Jenkins uses less memory for installation compared to other automation tools. </li>
                <li> Jenkins can be installed on most popular operating systems. </li>
                <li> The Jenkins community is vastly large and hence we can get support for many of the issues. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> Cons of using Jenkins </h4>
            <ul class="nested">
             <li> Jenkins is not free for private repositories. </li>
             <li> Even though Jenkins can be installed on windows, it does not provide further support for windows users. </li>
           </ul>
