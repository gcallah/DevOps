            </h1>
            
            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p> We have decided to move forward with Jenkins for our CI pipeline.
            For this we need to host Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance 
            and then connect it to the DevOps Github Repository </p>
            <h4>Installing Jenkins on AWS</h4>
                <ul class="nested">
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 1: Creating an AWS EC2 instance</b> 
                      </br>
                        Create an EC2 instance on the AWS 
                        account. Use a free tier eligible, 
                        Ubuntu server that comes with 
                        pre-installed Python 3.6<br> 
                        One thing to keep 
                        in mind is while associating security 
                        group to this EC2 instance
                        make sure the port 8080 is open to the world and 
                        download the secret key. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 2: SSH into the AWS machine</b> </br>
                      Next step is to SSH into the AWS machine using the 
                      credentials downloaded in the previous step.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 3: Installing Jenkins</b> </br>
                      Follow the steps in the link to install jenkins <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu" > Install Jenkins </a><br>
                      To start the Jenkins service : "sudo service jenkins start"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 4: Initial Jenkins setup </b> </br>
                      After following the previous steps, you need to go 
                      the url which is your public dns of your EC2 
                      instance:8080(E.g. http://ec2-aws.compute:8080) 
                      You should be able to see the jenkins server up and running.
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Here's a way of Trigerring a Jenkins 
            build from a push to Github.</h4>
                <p> A reason to choose Jenkins was the 
                availability of many plugins.
                One such plugin is the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Integration+Plugin">Github Integration Plugin</a>
               </p>

                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>
                    <b>Step 1: Install Github Integration Plugin</b><br>
                    It can be accessed through Plugin Manager under 
                    'available' tab or simply through search box.
                    After checking against the plugin, click on 'Download Now'.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> Step 2: Prepare Github Repository</b><br>
                    We now need to add service to call Jenkins Github 
                    webhook on a push.
                    Inside the github repo, go to Settings - Integrations 
                    & Services - Add service <br>
                    Select Jenkins(Github Integration) from 
                    drop-down menu.
                    In the new window, enter 
                    "Jenkins Hook URL+ "/github-webhook/"
                    e.g. http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/github-webhook/ <br>
                    Click on "test service"
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b>Step 3: Give repo access to Jenkins 
                    User</b><br>
                    This is a very important step. There are 
                    several ways to do so.<br>
                    1. use github OAuth plugin. <br>
                    2. Store plain-text user/password combo on Github
                    <br>
                    To be further discussed..
                    </li>
                </ul>
               <!-- add webhook related steps -->
               <!-- add slack integration steps and video link -->
            <h4>Slack integration with Jenkins</h4>
            <p> Slack is a tool used by companies on the whole 
            and inside teams for work related communication, 
            file sharing, notifications etc. It is important to 
            get notified if tests fail on Jenkins hence we have 
            integrated it with Slack to be well-informed.</p>
            <ul class="nested">
            <li> Step 1: On Jenkins page, go to Manage Plugins, 
            click on Available tab to show all available plugins.
            </li>
            <li> Step 2: In the search bar, type 'Slack'. You will 
            see all Slack related plugins. Select the 'Slack Notifier Plugin'.
            </li>
            <li> Step 3: Now click on 'Install without restart'. 
            You should see 'success' written. Now you have the plugin 
            successfully installed and ready to be configured.
            </li>
            <li> Step 4: click on Manage Plugins -- select Configure 
            System -- 
            scroll to the bottom of page to see section 'Global 
            Slack Notifier Settings'. You will see that it requires 
            a few important details to be filled in. We will get 
            these details from Slack.</li>
