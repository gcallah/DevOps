                <p>
                    Monitoring is a key part of DevOps because
                    monitoring is a source of feedback. Applications 
                    now are more business critical than ever. DevOps 
                    has brought automation to every stage of the 
                    application lifecycle which has significantly 
                    increased the speed from development to QA to
                    production.
                    Now there are frequent code commits with 
                    developers having to write comprehensive 
                    automated tests for their code. Every time a 
                    new commit occurs it automatically triggers all 
                    the unit and integration tests. Because development 
                    is striving more to use a production-like environment, 
                    monitoring becomes important.


                    Monitoring provides feedback about the application’s 
                    performance and usage patterns. This ensures the 
                    health and the availability of our IT systems and 
                    services. Effective monitoring is essential to 
                    allow DevOps teams to deliver at speed, 
                    get feedback from production, and 
                    increase customers satisfaction, acquisition 
                    and retention.

                    Synthetic Monitoring: Developers, testers and 
                    operations staff all need to ensure that their 
                    internet and intranet mobile applications and web 
                    applications are tested and operate successfully 
                    from different points of presence around the world.

                    Alert Management: Developers, testers and 
                    operations staff all need to send notifications 
                    via email, voice mail, text, mobile push 
                    notifications and Slack messages when specific 
                    situations or events occur in development, testing 
                    or production environments, to get the right people’s 
                    attention and to manage their response.

                    Deployment Automation: Developers, testers and 
                    operations staff use different tools to schedule 
                    and deploy complex applications and configure them 
                    in development, testing and production environments. 
                    We will discuss the best practices for these teams to 
                    collaborate effectively and efficiently and avoid 
                    potential duplication and erroneous information.

                    <li>
                    Analytics: Developers need to be able to look for 
                    patterns in log messages to identify if there is a 
                    problem in the code. Operations need to do root cause 
                    analysis across multiple log files to identify the 
                    source of the problem in complex application and 
                    systems.

                    Fault Detection: The primary goal of monitoring 
                    is to determine when a resource becomes unavailable 
                    or starts to perform poorly. As soon as performance 
                    and other issues arise rich diagnostic data is sent 
                    back to the development teams.  This is the time to 
                    detect(TTD). TTM is the time to mitigate these issues 
                    by the DevOps teams. The time taken to mitigate the 
                    issues are measured and are improved on. After 
                    mitigation, teams work on finding the root cause of 
                    the issue so that they do not occur again. This is 
                    the time to remediate(TTR).

                <li>
                 Validated Learning: A second goal is validated 
                 learning by tracking usage. Every deployment is an 
                 opportunity to track experimental results that support 
                 or diminish the hypotheses that led to the deployment. 
                 Tracking usage and differences between versions allows 
                 teams to measure the impact of change and drive business 
                 decisions. If a hypothesis is diminished, the team can 
                 “fail fast” or “pivot”. If the hypothesis is supported, 
                 then the team can double down or “persevere”. 
                 These data-informed decisions lead to new hypotheses 
                 and prioritisation of the backlog.
