                      Zabbix is an open source network monitoring tool that
                      works with a centralized Linux-based Zabbix server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The Zabbix server automatically collects and parses data
                      from monitored hardware so administrators can check
                      availability and see trends in network performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The server communicates to the native software agents
                      that are available for many operating systems,
                      including Linux, UNIX and Windows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For operating systems without an agent, generic
                      monitoring protocols such as Simple Network Management
                      Protocol (SNMP) or Intelligent Platform
                      Management Interface (IPMI) can be used.
