            <ul>
                <li>
                    Attend all sessions: these are
                    crucial stand-up meetings where
                    we coordinate our work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work steadily: it is completely
                    anti-DevOps to try to finish
                    your work in a rush at the
                    end of the semester. If you attempt
                    to do this, you will fail the course,
                    <i>regardless of whether
                    you submit "good" work or not</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Purchase at least one of the books
                    on the DevOps reading list.
