            DevOps and the Division of Labor
        </h1>

        <p>
         The benefits of the division of labor were, of course, recognized at least
        as far back as Plato and Xenophon. Adam Smith famously expounded upon them in
        <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>. In the early 20th century, this method of
        increasing productivity was pushed to its limits. Tasks were broken down to the
        extent that workers with minimal skills could be assigned simple, highly
        repetitive tasks, and perform them with almost no knowledge of what anyone else
        on the assembly line was up to. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
         Although this led to higher productivity of standardized products, the
        disadvantages of extending the division of labor to this extent were not
        overlooked. Karl Marx noted that the extensive division of labor alienated the
        worker from the product he was producing: someone who spends all day tightening
        a particular lug nut may be little able to associate what they do with "making
        a car." But even, Adam Smith, typically understood as a great proponent of the
        division of labor, commented:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote> In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the
            far greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of
            people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations, frequently to
            one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are
            necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life
            is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are
            perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert
            his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients
            for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore,
            the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as
            it is possible to become for a human creature to become. The torpor of his
            mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any
            rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender
            sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many
            even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive
            interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging...

         Smith is pointing out a <i>general</i> problem with the extensive division
        of labor, but there is a much more <i>particular</i> problem, which only came
        to prominence in the recent days of increasing automation and increasing demand
        for innovative and customized products: the sort of mindless, production-line
        division of tasks common in mid-20th-century factories created a workforce
        downright <i>encouraged</i> neither to think about how their work fit into the
        production process as a whole, nor how innovations in other parts they did not
        directly make might affect their own task. Such a holistic view was only
        supposed to be required of the engineers who designed new products or who
        designed the factory processes that would produce those new products. As in a
        socialist economy, all knowledge about the product and the production process
        would be concentrated at the top of a pyramid of work, and those below the peak
        were to just mindlessly follow the orders of those knowledge commissars. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
         A problem with this approach is that as products become more complicated
        and the pace of innovation increases, no single mind, or even a small group of
        minds, is capable of grasping all of the interconnections between the different
        parts of a complex product, and thus, cannot foresee how an innovation
        supposedly concerning only one part will actually have ripple effects on many
        other apparently separate production tasks. This fact was realized quite early
        at Toyota, and led to the invention of the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">Toyota Production
        System</a>, the forerunner of Lean Software Development.

         As important as these ideas were in factory production, their importance is
        even greater in the world of software development, where production is
        <i>always</i> production of a novel product: otherwise, one would simply buy or
        rent an existing software product, which is almost always a lower cost venture
        than "rolling your own."
        </p>
        
        <p>
         In such an environment, it is simply not possible to assign the "workers"
        (programmers) a simple, repetitive task, and expect them to achieve decent
        results without at least some understanding of the overall product design, as
        well as an understanding of how their particular "part" integrates with the
        other parts of the product as a whole. In such a situation, worker obedience no
        longer "works." A manager cannot tell a software engineer working on a product
        of even moderate complexity to just follow the manager's orders: the programmer
        can bring production to a halt simply by asking, "OK, what line of code should
        I write next?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
         But further: no knowledge worker producing an even moderately complex
        product can do his work properly without his understanding of his part in the
        production process evolving in continuous interaction with the evolving
        understanding of all of the other knowledge workers involved in the product:
        one such worker gaining a better understanding of the nature of her component
        simply <i>must</i> convey that understanding to all other workers upon whom the
        changes in her component have an impact, and that set of workers typically
        encompasses <i>everyone</i> working on the product. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
         The various aspects of "DevOps" production follow from the nature of
        knowledge workers cooperating to create innovative products.
        Programmers cannot do their jobs in isolation: thus, <i>continuous
            integration</i>. Testers cannot test successfully unless they are
        part of the production process from day one: thus, <i>continuous
            testing</i>. Operations cannot successfully deploy constantly
        evolving products unless deployment itself becomes a software
        product: thus, <i>software as infrastructure</i>. The "business"
        stakeholders in the product cannot ensure the product is really meeting
        business needs unless they are continually engaged in the development
        process: thus the lean and agile principles of <i>continual
            interaction</i> between the engineers and
        the "business people." How new versions of a piece of software impact
        the end users cannot be determined without continual feedback from
        those users: thus, <i>incremental development</i>, <i>continuous
            deployment</i>, and <i>continuous
        monitoring</i>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
         And since, in our brave new world, <a
            href="https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/04/22/twims-prince-magic-leap-hbr-software-intel-minecraft/">every
            business is a software business</a>, no business that wants to
        survive can ignore the DevOps revolution.
