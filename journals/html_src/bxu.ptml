          Brief Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Bowei Xu and I am a graduate student pursuing Master
          degree of Computer Science in Tandon School of engineering. I am
          taking this course to learn about this popular software engineering
          culture and prepare for the future career. I am excited to learn
          about the history and motivation of this culture and what the
          benefits it could bring to our engineers. Also I would like to know
          the advantage and disadvantage compared to other engineering culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I do look forward to the whole-class project for excising so
          we can experience how powerful DevOps could be in real-world
          development progress.

          We build the Team page for our team to provide all information on it.
          We present our new UI to the whole class and get suggestion from
          customers. And we also start tesing and immigrating the styles into
          original one.

            The cutover has been tested and finished on most main page and
            the feedback is pretty good so far. We keep helping people who have

          on the home page. The communication is still in research.
