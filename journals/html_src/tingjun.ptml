            About Tingjun Zhang
        </p>
        <p>
            Hello there, this is Tingjun Zhang. 
            A CS master student from NYU. 
            I take this course to get a hands-on 
            experience of real-world development.
            I am more interested in backend development 
            so I joined in the coding group. 
            I am familiar with Java and nodeJS. 
            This time I will try Django. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Normally, we just create some simple and naive 
            demo projects in the class. 
            But this time, we will create a real-world 
            project during this semester. 
            Exciting!
        </p>
