            <p>
              As a graduate student expecting to graduate soon,
              I have gained quite a few development skills and know-hows of
              platforms, infrastructure and frameworks working in tandem.
              However, as a developer I often find myself annoyed by the fact
              that a lot of time and effort has to be spent on the
              "bureaucracy" (searching for euphemism..) of everything,
              from setting up the evironment, the testing framework to the
              deployment and redeployment of the releases. Working on a solo
              project, one has to worry about all of these, apart from writing a
              working and efficient code. One of the reasons I would release
              large updates rather than small incremental ones would be to
              reduce this "inconvenience", not that it helped. How I wished all
              of this could be automated!!
              <br>
              So here I am trying to learn how.
            </p>

              Weekly updates:
            </h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Week 1 and 2 : I joined the 'coding' team and picked
                'Practical Devops - Joakim Verona' to study and review. Within
                the coding team, we divided the group into pairs to target the
                various tasks on the Trello board. My first assignment would be
                to work on an html spell-checker.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 3: I paired with Pravar to push the initial release of the
                 spell-checker. This week we learned about Docker and had some
                 hands-on with it. We could leverage a docker container to
                 develop locally with a Django container which could be deployed
                 as is to the cloud provider of choice.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 4: This week we added certain critical features to the
                 spell-checker. It can now add new words to dictionary and
                 extract word between punctuations. We also met with Professor
                 Callahan to discuss the progress with the tool. Professor
                 made some great recommendations and we look forward to
                 implementing them.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 5: This week we had this great opportunity of listening to
                 System Adminitstration veteran Tom Limoncell's take on DevOps.
                 He talked about the 'Three ways of DevOps' and DevOps as a
                 practice, rather than a set of tools. In his words, 'DevOps' is
                 taking Agile all the way to 'Ops'.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 6: We pushed the documentation for the spell-checker. This
                 week we had Tom Germano from Google as a guest lecturer. He
                 spoke about his role at Google in the Gmail team.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 7: Spring Break!
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 8: We added a feature to maintain a separate custom
                dictionary to add words. The dictionaries can now be sent in as
                CL parameters. This week we had Joe West of BounceX fame. He
                talked about "The Four Things I Wish You Knew About DevOps
                (but couldn’t reasonably expect you to learn in this class)".
                He advised not to go overboard with all the DevOps tools and
                cloud services out there. Choices should be business specific
                and should improve productivity. After all, 'Productivity is
                the best practice'. He also mentioned the importance of
                'Documenting and Rehearsing' and shared that he actually enjoys
                when things get boring. It probably means that at that point,
                things are well organized and under control.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 9: This week we utilized regular expressions to capture
                 and filter words in the spell-checker. I also spent some time
                reading 'Practical DevOps', the book I am planning on reviewing.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 10: We tweaked the spell-checker tool to ignore text
                 between 'code' tags. We also started posting our review of the
                 book 'Practical DevOps' by Joakim Verona.
               </li>
               <li>
                 Week 11: I have not had much experience with application
                 security, specially vulnerability at development stages and
                 pre-release, for eg. if the packaging stage is compromised,
                 potentially every instance of the released product could be
                 malicious. We learnt about the importance of security at every
                 level of the Dev+Ops pipeline.
