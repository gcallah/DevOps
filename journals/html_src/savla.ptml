        My DevOps Story
    </h1>

    <p>
    DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims
    at unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops).
     The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate
      automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction,
      from integration, testing, releasing to deployment
      and infrastructure management.
    I am exicted to learn about this field.

                It is fascinating how light weight docker is
                in comparison to virtulization
                and how it can be used
                to run micro services.

                  He works in the team that handles 'Join'
                  on the database, which sounds easy but
                  is pretty complicated when scaled to millions
                   of nodes that are accounted during a particular
                   google search or inside gmail.

                   Business is the thing: We must
                   give thought to cost,
                   business and purpose before resorting
                   to the tools instead of using t
                   hem just because they are cool.

                  <li>
                  Rightsize toolchain:  It is
                  importnat to understand where
                  the optimization is worth.

                  Productivity is the best
                  practice: We must try to
                  automate things that are
                  done repeatedly and take
                  much of our time.

                  <li>
                  Document and rehearse:
                  Documentation is essential.
                  Rehearsing critical
                  events makes us better equiped
                  at handling the real scenarios.
