          Brief Introduction
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a graduate student majored in Computer Science in NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
          I take this devops course to learn how the real world is developing real softwares.
          I spent most of my software developing in school, and before I graduate, I really want to
          have a glimpse of how people are developing softwares now, and why the ways of developing software
          is changing. I am excited to participating in this hands-on course to learn DevOps.

          During the first two weeks, I have leant some basic concepts in DevOps, including the history
          of DevOps, the reason why DevOps emerges, the lean developing and so on. The lectures have been
          very helpful to me, as these concepts are taught using examples and hands-on project.
