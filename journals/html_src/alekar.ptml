          I first came across the term DevOps while I was working as a summer intern at CooperSurgical. I was assigned a project for which I was required to learn more about Docker and also use it. While I was doing my research and reading information related to Docker on various tutorial websites, I came across the term DevOps. I started to gather more information and I realized that the DevOps culture is something most orgranizations should adopt, if not all.

        The main characteristics of DevOps and what I think sets it apart from other practices:

        <ol class=“nested”>
          <li>Rapid Delivery</li>
          <li>Feedback</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
        </ol>

        Primitive software engineering practices have become outdated as software has become an integral part of every single business. What I realized after reading about DevOps is that orgranizations using a DevOps model will do much better than those not using one.

        I come across many interesting terms while reading articles on the internet and DevOps was one of such many terms. After some slight research on the internet, I didn't think about it until Professor Callahan mentioned that he planned to start a DevOps course in Spring 2018. I decided to register for the course almost instantly.
        Not only is this a new course at NYU, but it is one of the few DevOps courses offered by universities in the USA. I strongly feel this course is essential in all universities as adopting the DevOps cultures needs a change in mindset. With DevOps, the quality of services that businesses provide to customers will definitely increase.

      By studying DevOps I hope to learn how to work on projects more efficiently and how to accelerate the process of product delivery by continously analyzing customer feedback and monitoring the system as a whole. I hope to learn more the DevOps culture and in the future hope to adopt the practice.
