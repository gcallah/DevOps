            Build Tools Comparison
        </h1>

        <p>
            A "Build tool" is a single term that refers to anything that is needed
             to get a piece of software set up, but isn't needed after that. There 
             are numerous number of build tools each having a different set of 
             tradeoffs associated with them. Here are some of the major build tools 
             and their features:
        </p>
        <details>
                <summary class="sum2">
                    Make
                </summary>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <p>
                        Make was first created in 1976, but the variants of this build 
                        tool are still going strong in today’s world of system development. In 
                        make we have to specify dependency followed by a rule to resolve those 
                        dependencies. It is a powerful product oriented tool which is highly capable
                        of tracking dependencies within a build and building only those parts/components
                        that have been updated/changed. Thus helping in optimizing performance whereby
                        compilation time is crucial in development cycles. The drawback of this
                        tool is that with increase in the rise of complexity, the number of dependency
                        between their component also increases causing the rules even more complex 
                        making it really hard to debug. To make things better for this drawback we
                        regularly see teams making a MakeFile in each sub-directory and a top level 
                        MakeFile. The top level MakeFile recursively runs the subdirectories 
                        resulting in the build information and processes to spread over many files.
                        The other drawbacks of this tool is that due to significant amount of
                        whitespaces it makes it susceptible to hard-to-find class of bugs.
                        Make is also OS specific since it relies on shell scripting. Many developers
                        have started using SCons instead of Make.

                        Ant is a task oriented build tool which was first released in 2000. The 
                        limitations found in Make tool led to the Java Community to experiment different
                        solutions such as porting Make to Java. At this same time XML was coming up into 
                        prominence as a build tool. Combining the power of both these approaches led to 
                        the Apache Ant build tool. Being fully cross platform , a set of instructions 
                        are writted in Java to basic operations like compilation and file manipulation. 
                        Besides being cross-platform it is also an extremely flexible and powerful system,
                        with Ant Tasks for most things we want to do. Despite of being powerful, 
                        it comes with certain drawbacks namely the build scripts have to be written 
                        in XML (not quite pleasant for human readability), a lot of time has to be spent
                        in performing tasks (writing boiler plate to compile, create jars, run tests etc)
                        due to lack of a real domain concept. Ant files are poorly factored and tend to
                        get really long, it wont be surprising if we see thousands of lines long.

                        Maven is another build tool that was released in 2004. Maven was built 
                        with the goal to improve on the problems that were faced while using the Ant tool.
                        Maven still has use of XML but relatively less when compared to the Ant tool. Maven 
                        guaranties that it will perform any kind of build, deploy, test and release task with a
                        single command as long as we conform to the structure dictated by Maven. The disadavntage 
                        lies in the fact that we have to conform to the Maven structure, if we dont follow the 
                        Maven structure then it is almost impossible to make Maven do what we want. Another 
                        disadvantage lies in the fact that it uses an external DSL (Domain Specific Language) 
                        written in XML, which means that if we want to extend it then we have to spend a lot of time 
                        learning something extra and making it work. Maven might also end up creating issues since it 
                        continuously tries to automatically upgrade itself every time it runs, this means some 
                        plugins might end up failing and we wont be able to reproduce our builds.

                        Build tools are usually used to perform pre-checks in 
                        the code before they are sent out for testing and 
                        deployments. 
                        Consider a scenario where there are hundreds of 
                        developers working on the single project. 
                        Each developers have certain unique coding style.
                        If each developer commits their changes according to 
                        their style or ideology, there would be hundreds of
                        different styles leading to inconsistencies all 
                        over code base. This is where build tools come into
                        picture. As seen in our class the use of html checker 
                        allowed developers to deploy only after the 
                        checks were successful. There are other aspects and 
                        uses of build tools too. The build tools performs 
                        dependencies check, 
                        improve compile and link time and 
                        reduces the bad builds. 
                        
                        PyBuild is one of the build tools which is largely 
                        based for Python Projects. 
                        PyBuild supports all the standard features of a 
                        typical build tools.

                        There are tons of plugins created by Python 
                        developers to 
                        support easy building of Python Projects. 
                        The plugins are present for the following 
                        areas in Build:
                        
                        <ul class=“nested”>
                          <li>Unit Testing</li>
                          <li>Measuring Unit Test Coverage</li>
                          <li>Linting Python Source</li>
                          <li>Python Checker</li>
                        </ul>
