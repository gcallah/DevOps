                Building and Git Submodules
            </summary>

            <p>
                We rely on git submodules in several areas of our
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/AgileCourseware/index.html">agile courseware</a>
                program.
                But this dependence can be tricky: while git supports
                submodules, it often does not seem to "like" doing so! Here we
                will write up some problems we've hit in that area.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                The first thing we are going to document is how to clone from a
                repository.
                We need to open our terminal and cd into the file we want to
                clone our repository in. Once we have done that
                we run the following command:<br/>
                <code>
                git clone https://github.com/gcallah/DevOps.git
                </code>
                <br/>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the
                GitHub webpage shown below in the second screenshot.)
            </p>

            <p>
                If you need to add a submodule whether for first time or again,
                it is actually easier than some of the online document that
                suggest.For instance, to add TheDevOpsCourse to DevOps, you
                would just run:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                git submodule add https://github.com/gcallah/TheDevOpsCourse.git
                </code>
                <br>
                (That last parameter is the clone string you get from the
                GitHub webpage.)
                <br>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Sometimes a submodule can be corrupted and will have to be
                removed. This process is difficult !

                       Symbolic Link or Soft link is nothing but a file that 
                       points to another file. In out root directory we have
                       the submakefile and if we look closely at the makefile
                       inside each team directory (build,cloud,monitoring etc)
                       using commands:  
                       <code>ls -las</code>

                    <p>
                       We see that makefile is referring to submakefile with
                       a pointer (makefile --&gt ../submakefile).

                       Following is the command to create a symbolic link:-<br>
                       <code>ln -s source_file destination_file</code><br>
                       In order to create a makefile to perform the build
                       process we will have to do the following in the main
                       directory:-<br>
                       <code>ln -s submakefile destination_file</code><br>
                       NOTE:- The destination_file should not be created in the
                       destination directory prior to running this command.
                       It will be created by itself when we run it.

        </summary>
            <p>
                    Build tools control the building of a final product
                    from some number of pieces that compose that product.
                    The final product could be a web page, a compiled
                    executable, a piece of documentation, or a book.

                    Please Note that the following steps are only for
                    Linux, MacOS. 

                    Windows users, please have a look at the bottom of
                    the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key characteristics of build tools are that:

                    <li>
                        They automate the build process.

                        They re-build only what is necessary to re-build.

                    <p>
                    If you want to make changes to an html file, do not
                    directly edit it! Each directory(eg. cloud, testing...etc.)
                    has a html_src folder/dir. This html_src folder contains
                    .ptml files for all .html files. So, in order to edit
                    ‘abc.html’, we need to edit ‘abc.ptml’
                    </p>
                    <ul class="contents">
                    <li>
                    Step 1: navigate to required html_src folder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Step 2: edit ‘abc.ptml’ file
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Step 3:<br>

                            <code>git commit abc.ptml</code>

                    <li>
                    Step 4: <code>cd .. </code>(basically come to outer directory)

                    Step 5: Do you see a makefile? great! :blush:<br>

                    <li>
                    Step 6: now check your abc.html file. It should have all
                    changes made to abc.ptml
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Step 7: git add and git commit the abc.html file
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Step 8: <br><code>git push</code>

         How to install Command Line Tool on Mac OS X ?
        </summary>
        <p>The steps listed below will guide you through the process of
           installing command line tool on Mac OS X</p>
            <ol type = "1" class="nested">
                <li> Launch terminal which can be found in /Applications/Utilities</li>
                <li> Type the following command:<br><br>
                    <code>xcode-select --install</code><br><br>
                    Terminal will display the following if you haven't
                    downloaded it before:<br><br>
                    <code> x-code select: note: install requested for command
                    line developer tools </code><br><br>
                    However if you have downloaded it before then you will get
                    the following message:<br><br>
                    <code> xcode-select: error: command line tools are already
                    installed, use "Software Update" to install updates</code>
                </li>
                <li> A simple software update pop up will prompt you to select
                     one of the three options.Options are Get Xcode, Not now
                     and Install. Get Xcode will install both Xcode and the
                     command line developer tools from the App Store. Not
                     now will quit the installation process. Install will lead
                     to installation of the command line tool once you have
                     accepted the "Terms of Service".</li>
                <li> The Command Line Tools package may take upto several
                     minutes to download based on your connection speed.</li>
                <li> The installer goes ahead smoothly and completes on its own
                    . You can confirm everything is working as expected by
                     trying out the commands like gcc, git, svn, rebase, make,
                     ld, otool, nm. </li>
                <li> The command line toolkit package can be found
                    in the following directory:<br><br>
                     <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ </code></li>
