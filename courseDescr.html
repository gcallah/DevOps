            DevOps: Course Description
        </h1>

        <p>
            DevOps is an umbrella term covering the latest thinking in software
            development and computer center operations. It encompasses Lean and
            Agile development practices, software as infrastructure for
            automating IT configuration and deployment, automated testing, 
            continuous integration, continuous delivery, version control
            systems, value-stream mapping, Kanban boards,
            and other technological practices. But first and foremost,
            DevOps means breaking down the barriers between business units,
            development teams, quality assurance, security, and operations,
            barriers that all too often wind up blocking the creation of
            value-generating software.

        <p>
            This course will teach DevOps principles and practices through
            hands-on participation in developing a real-world software project.
            The class will divide up the work on the project the way an
            actual software team would, and apply DevOps principles and
            technologies to make the work proceed efficiently and enjoyably.
