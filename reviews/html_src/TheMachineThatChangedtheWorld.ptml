            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>

          When The Machine That Changed the World
          was first published in 1990,
          Toyota was half the size of General Motors.
          Today Toyota is passing GM as the world's
          largest auto maker and is the most consistently
          successful global enterprise of the past
          fifty years. This management classic
          was the first book to reveal Toyota's
          lean production system that is
          the basis for its enduring success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now reissued with a new Foreword
          and Afterword, Machine contrasts
          two fundamentally different business
          systems -- lean versus mass, two very
          different ways of thinking about how
          humans work together to create value.
          Based on the largest and most thorough
          study ever undertaken of any
          industry -- MIT's five-year,
          fourteen-country International Motor
          Vehicle Program -- this book describes t
          he entire managerial system of
          lean production.
        </p>
        <p>
           Nearly twenty years ago, Womack, Jones,
           and Roos provided a comprehensive
           description of the entire
           lean system. They exhaustively documented
           its advantages over the mass production
           model pioneered by General Motors
           and predicted that lean production would
           eventually triumph. Indeed, they argued
           that it would triumph
           not just in manufacturing but in every
           value-creating activity
           from health care to retail to distribution.

          Chapter 1 - The Industry of Industries in Transition
        </h2>

        <p>
          This chapter talks about how Toyota surpassed
          GM as the largest automaker due to implementing
          the practice of lean production.
          This chapter gives a brief idea about
          the differences between craft
          production, mass production and lean production.
          Craft Production: Makes use of highly skilled
          workers to create custom goods which are
          expensive and are of high quality.
          Mass Production: Makes use of semi-skilled
          workers to produce same kind of product in
          large quantity. This production technique
          requires a large space, large number of
          workers and is quite inflexible.
          Lean Production: Everything is
          less compared to mass production
          technique. Makes use of half the
          space, workers, time, investment in tools
          and the time to develop the product by using
          skilled workers and pushing responsibility
          down the organizational hierarchy.

                Chapter 2 - The Rise and Fall of Mass Production
              </h2>
              <p>
              This chapter focusses on mass production and
              lean production. The author starts by talking
              about mass production in the late 1800s and
              how it wouldn't be feasble in today's world.
              He gives us a brief introduction of Evelyn Ellis
              (the first person to drive an automobile in England)
              and P & L and summarizes craft production.
              The craft production companies, to the author's
              surprise, survived till the present day by
              continuing to focus on tiny niches, their
              target customers being the super rich who
              could afford such luxury. For example,
              Aston Martin. A definite threat to these
              craft firms was lean production which was
              especially significant in countries like
              Japan. The key to mass production according
              to the author was "the complete and
              consistent interchangeability of parts
              and the simplicity of attaching them to
              each other". Interchangeability, simplicity
              and ease of attachment taken together gave
              Ford many advantages over his competition.
              The author takes a look at the precise
              characteristics that made Ford successful.

          		<li> <u>Work force</u></li>
          		<li> <u>Organization</u></li>

          		<li> <u>Product</u></li>
          		</h6>
          		</ul>

              The author then talks about how Alfred Sloan of
               General Motors was a worthy and necessary
               competitor to Ford. "Sloan's innovative
               thinking also seemed to resolve the conflict
               between the need for standardization to cut
               manufacturing costs and the model diversity
               required by the huge range of consumer demand."
              The diffusion of mass production was due to the
              rise of lean production, the birthplace of
              which was said to be Tokyo, Japan.
              "The Japanese were developing an entirely
               new way of making things, which we call
               lean production." We will now move on to
               chapter 3 where the author talks about
               the rise of lean production.

                  Chapter 3 - The Rise of Lean Production
              </h2>
              <p>
                This chapter describes how Ohno studied Ford’s
                 mass production system and noticed that their
                 view of letting defects creep into the last
                 stage and rework on them let to endless
                 multiplication of defects.

                He tries to develop a system wherein workers
                work in teams lead by team leaders and have
                the power to stop the entire line if the
                encounter a problem they can’t fix. Eventually
                all problems got documented and Toyota
                yields approached a 100%.

                Ohno didn’t want to integrate the vertical
                and followed a building to order system
                than the other way around.

                  Chapter 4 - Running the Factory
              </h2>
              <p>
                The author draws a comparison between
                GM’s and Toyota’s production system.
                They compare the space used, inventory,
                time and defects between both plants to
                conclude that Toyota’s plant was more
                efficient. They also studied more plants
                throughout the world and assert that it’s
                wrong to equate lean production to Japan
                and mass with the Western world.
                The truly lean plant has two key organizational
                features: Tasks and responsibilities are
                transferred to those workers actually adding
                value to the car on the line. There is a system
                for detecting defects that quickly traces every
                problem, once discovered, to its ultimate cause.
                In the end, it is the dynamic work team that
                emerges as the heart of the lean factory.
                Building these efficient teams is not simple.
                First, workers need to be taught a wide variety
                of skills so that tasks can be rotated and workers
                can fill in for each other. Workers also
                need to be good at simple machine repair,
                quality checking, housekeeping, and
                materials-ordering. They must also have
                the ability to think proactively to devise
                solutions before problems become serious.
