            <p>
              This book aims to introduce the thinking tools for software
              development process to go agile. It functions as
              a toolkit to help translate widely accepted lean principles
              into practices that can be customized to individual software
              development domains. The author is
              trying to dig out the potential improvement for development
              process.
              <br />
              This book contains 22 thinking tools to help develop the agile
              practices that work best in all people's particular domains.
              These tools are summarized into 7 lean principals from which
              they are translated.

              These principles and its related toolkits are introduced in
              details one principle each chapter and provide
              practical suggestions for implementing the priciples and these
              toolkits. Very good book for workers in manager level.

                    Chapter 1: Eliminate Waste
                </summary>
                <p>
                  According to the author, This concept, Eliminate waste,
                  is first brought up by
                  Taiichi Ohno, known as the father of the Toyota Production
                  System, to deal with the conflict of market requirement and
                  manufacture cost. In this concept, he gives waste a new
                  definition "Anything that does not create value for a
                  customer is waste. A part that is sitting around waiting to
                  be used is waste. Making something that is not immediately
                  needed is waste. Motion is waste. Transportation is waste.
                  Waiting is waste. Any extra processing steps are waste.
                  And of course defects are waste"[2]. The core of his ideal is
                  that immediate production delivery is better than inventory.
                  The history has proven the validity of his idea and this
                  concept is becoming the most fundamental lean principles that
                  all other principles should follow from.

                <p>
                  Then the authors give us a guide on how to implement
                  the principals by introducing two toolkits.
                  The first toolkit, also should be the first step is
                  learning to see waste. If a thing can't
                  contribute to customer's perception or there is a way to go
                  around it, it is waste. By this definition, Windston Royce
                  had seen all steps besides coding and analysis are waste to
                  development in 1970[3]. The authors metion this because it is
                  a good start to re-evalue steps in development waterfall
                  process. Then the authors translates the 7 wastes of
                  manufacturing identified by Shigeo into 7 corresponding
                  wastes in software development.

                  Partially done work will not get in the way of other
                  development but also yields no valuable delivery and tie up
                  resources. It also gonna be a high risk in final production.

                  Unnecessary paperwork are a mass extra cost to Development
                  process. Paperwork should be something eager to use and
                  need to transmit effective information.

                    <th>
                  Extra features that seems harmless  would increase complexity
                  and tential failure point. Codes that not needed now should
                  be treated as waste.

                    Assigning people multiple projects is a waste since the
                    switch among them would cost much time for developers
                    to switch their thoughts and may cause interruptions.
                    With same resource, projects should be done one by one.

                    <th>Waiting[4]</th>
                    <th>
                      Waiting is one of the biggest wastes that delys are very
                      common in software development. It keeps
                      customers from realizing value as soon as possible[1].

                    <th>
                      The process of motion could become waste in process, not
                      only the people, but also the artifact information. Team
                      work apart would cost time to communicate with each other
                      . Handoff document from group to group also would be the
                      source since it can't contain all creater's knowledge.

                    <th>
                      Defect is a waste due to its impact and its undetected
                      period. The reduction can be improved by testing
                      immediately, integrating often and release as soon as
                      possible.

                Although items like management, project tracking would not
                directly contribute to the production process, they are still
                very important because wastes mentioned above can be minimized
                by these systems.

                The second step(toolkit) of implementation introduced by the
                author is value stream mapping. The author bring up the
                comparison between traditional development process and agile
                development by value stream map. It is very obvious that
                where the delays and waste are in process.
                From this, we are well acknowledged of the power of the value
                stream map. It is very helpful for management level to take an
                overall view of the process and uncover all hidden waste which
                should be eliminated. A value stream map is also a effective
                tool that development team can acknowledge the biggest
                opportunities to deliver value and expediate the workflow.
                The author also give an simplified action model to create
                and apply the value stream map in the last part of this
                section.

                    Chapter 3: Decide as late as possible
                </summary>
                <p>
                  So in this part, the authors brings up the priority of
                  concurrent development over sequatial development and
                  what is "decide as late as possible"[5] and why. They start
                  with the comparison of cost of adapting changes to die design
                  in American and Japanese car production process in 80s last
                  century. The cost in Japan is much lower not due to a better
                  original design but because they are using a more
                  efficient and change-tolerance method, concurrent process.
                  And same in software development, programing has shown great
                  improvement after switching to concurrent development[6].
                  Instead of traditional depth-first design that constrains
                  high-level and low-level decisions together,
                  the new developemt applies breadth-first approach in design
                  that high-level problem or changes can be adapted with much
                  less cost since breadth-first method allow engineers
                  to consider most options so inevitable changes or problems
                  can be found and worked out as soon as
                  possible which will overal cost much less time in deliverying
                  the final product. Also, software is the kind of product that
                  requires lifetime uprgade and these upgrades are not small
                  even compared to the original product. So the design of
                  a product should be more flexible to accept possible changes
                  that could occur in development process or after release to
                  avoid cost escalation. Decide as late as possible could help
                  with it since it could help minimized the high-stake
                  constrains and apply breadth-first approach to make them as
                  correct as possible. It also can reduce the decisions number
                  leading to changes and the cost escalation factor for
                  changes. So using concurrent development and decide as late
                  as possible help reduce the cost by minimize the constrains
                  of a product to accept changes and reduce the changes cost.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The first tool introduced in this part is options thinking.
                  As mentioned by the authors, the attraction of satisfication
                  guaranteed warranties is that irrevocable decision is not
                  preferred by people when there is uncertainty. They use HP
                  printer sales as a good example of how delay decisions helps
                  in this condition that they make the electrical configuration
                  of their printers after the orders are made so there could be
                  adjustment among countries with different configuration.
                  This is called "option open"[7] that delay the decision
                  that make less constrains on options until the uncertainty
                  gone. Another example given is the Microsoft which
                  also gambled in options by providing several systems that
                  allow them to hold most options in market to reduce risk. And
                  same in software development, minimize the options limit by
                  delaying decisions until the customer requirement is clear
                  or mature technology has been achieved would reduce cost in
                  future changes or adjustment. However, the authors emphasize
                  that options thinking is not something guaranteeing success
                  but move the development into a favorable direction when
                  there is uncertainty. To well apply it, engineer must be
                  experienced and research much to decide which options
                  should be open instead of keeping everything open.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The second tool is the last responsible moment. According to
                  previous approach, concurrent development allow delay
                  commitment but the delay has to be a deadline. The last
                  responsible moment is the toolkit to help make decisions.
                  It is the due date that commitments have to be made to
                  eliminate other important alternatives, or decisions would be
                  made by default[8]. The authors shows several practical
                  tactics to help. These tactics not only
                  help make decision before the last responsible moment but
                  also teach us how to decide and improve the last
                  responsible moment. I will summaize several main tactics in
                  this part:
                  <br />
                  1. Share partially complete design information[9]:
                  This helps
                  reduce the length of feedback and shorten the exploratory
                  cycles. <br />
                  2. Organize for direct, worker-to-worker collaboration[9]:
                  This is demanded heavily when partial complete design is
                  shared. People knwo details in requirement and implementation
                  must work closely to refine in development process.<br />
                  3. Develop a sense of how to absorb changes[9]:
                  This part brings some tactics that experts use to endorse in
                  OOP design or any component-based development. <br />
                  4. Develop a sense of what is critically important in the
                  domain[9]:
                  Some features are so important that they drive early
                  commitments which turns out to be flawed. It will narrow the
                  field and overlook some critical elements than late
                  commitment. So it should be clear what is more important.
                  <br />
                  5. Develop a sense of when decisions must be made[9]:
                  Delay commitment doesn't mean no commitment. A keen sense of
                  timing and mechanism must be developed to make decisions in
                  time.<br />
                  6. Develop a quick response capability[9]:
                  Response time is the capacibility to allow late commitments.
                  The faster the response can be made, the later the
                  commitments can be made.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                  The third tool is making decisions. In this part, the authors
                  have summarized some components in previous tools and talk
                  about approaches in decision making. First, they talk about
                  the comparison between depth-first approach and breadth-first
                  one as mentioned in the first tool and claim their advantages
                  and risk and see conidtions which approach should be applied.
                  Breath-first approach is normally the more effective one
                  since it has less limitaion and requirement. Then talk
                  about the intuitive decision making compared to rational
                  decision making. It is actually pretty surprising that
                  intuitive decision making performs better in most conditions
                  that high-stakes mistakes is more likely detected because
                  rational decision would suffer tunnel version and timing.
                  The authors have given examples in fire department and
                  the Marines to support this opinion which is pretty
                  convincing. At last, the author clarify that the rules that
                  decision making follows must be simple. Simple rule can
                  help well in flexibility, robustness and
                  self-organization[10]. It allows people to act quickly
                  without waiting and as mentioned before, quicker
                  action/response allows later decision making.
