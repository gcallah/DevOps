              Introduction
              </h2> 
              <p>
                  The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created
                  by seventeen software developers in 2001. The Agile Manifesto
                  expressed four key values and twelve principles of Agile
                  software development. Founded upon the values and principles
                  stated in the Agile Manifesto, Agile software development
                  utilizes the iterative approach that delivers new pieces
                  of the application more often and provides greater
                  flexibility than the traditional waterfall approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Manifesto for Agile Software Development provides 
                  critical guidance on how to apply Agile practices to 
                  software development.

              Core values and principles
              </h2>
              <details>
                <summary class="sum2">
                    The first core value - Individuals and interactions
                    over processes and tools
                </summary>
                <p>
                  The first key value of the Agile Manifesto is to value
                  people and communication over rigid processes and tools. 
                  If a company value processes and tools, the processes are 
                  on average more clear but the processes and tools will be 
                  gradually out-of-date due to the lack of updates. New 
                  processes and tools are created by humans. In a 
                  human-centric company, the improvements made to processes 
                  and tools by its employees greatly boost the company's 
                  overall productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the principles relevant to the first key value is 
                  that business people and developers must work together on 
                  a daily basis. The communication is of great importance in 
                  DevOps as listed above. Since the requirements are constantly
                  changing and the highest priority is for the customer, 
                  working together helps the developers quickly notice the 
                  requirement changes and react accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another related principle states that the face-to-face 
                  conversation is the most efficient and effective method for 
                  communication within a development team. The information is 
                  more likely to divert via multiple channels. The 
                  face-to-face communication also delivers the most original 
                  idea, which reduces risk of misinterpreting and 
                  misunderstanding.

                    The second core value - Working software over comprehensive
                    documentation
                </summary>
                <p>
                The second key value shows that working software is more
                important than comprehensive documentation. As stated in the
                principles, working software is the primary way to measure the
                development progress. In that case, working software is more 
                persuading than the documentation. The teammates are more 
                likely to honor your progress by working software instead of 
                the documentation. However, the documentation can be the 
                resource that assists in the understanding of working software.
                </p>
                <p>
                As mentioned above, in order to show the development progress, 
                the quick delivery of working software helps. The shorter 
                timescale informs other teammates about the development 
                progress and improves the communication within the 
                development team. It also reduces the work of detailed 
                documentation because some codes are pretty self-explanatory 
                in the absence of detailed documentation.

                    The third core value - Customer collaboration over contract
                    negotiation
                </summary>
                <p>
                The third key value of the Agile Manifesto is to focus on
                collaboration between the development team and customer, 
                instead of emphasizing contract negotiation. 
                Collaboration will make the product more valuable since the 
                customer is involved to provide helpful feedback to increase 
                values of the product during the sprint review. 
                In addition, technologies and the customer's needs
                are rapidly changing. Hence it's hard to determine all the
                details of the product at the very beginning. By collaborating 
                with the customer, the development team can integrate needed 
                changes with the existing product in a smooth manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The highest priority is to satisfy the customer. As we 
                    have seen in the manifesto, the agile development delivers 
                    the new versions as soon as possible. In this instance, 
                    working with customers help the products to be quickly 
                    updated and upgraded to meet the customers' needs.
                    Meanwhile, making changes to the products quickly also 
                    gathers customers' feedback soon and is of great help
                    for the products.

                    The fourth core value - Responding to change over following
                    a plan
                </summary>
                <p>
                The fourth key value of the Agile Manifesto is that reacting to
                change is superior to up-front planning. It's not viable to
                create a detailed plan in advance if the project context is
                constantly changing and less information is available at the
                present time. Feedback from the customer might demand
                project plan changes as well within the project's timeframe. 
                What's more, the goal of delivering maximum value to the 
                customer is more important than simply following a plan even 
                though plan changes might be needed in order to achieve the 
                goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Changing requirements are welcome in agile development since 
                  agile devolvement iterates rapidly.
                  Changing requirements allow the developers to react quickly
                  to customers' needs, which not only improves customers' 
                  feedback, but also the product quality. Shorter timescale is
                  preferred. Since work is done in small batches, the defects 
                  and problems can be easily detected and resolved early. It 
                  also helps the developers to identify the problems precisely.
