        <b>What is monitoring?</b><br>
        From a technological perspective, monitoring is the tools and
        processes by which you measure and manage your IT systems.
        Monitoring is something that provides the translation between business
        value and the metrics generated by your systems and applications.
        These metrics can be translated into measurable user experience, which
        in turn provides feedback to the business to help ensure the delivery
        of customers requirements. It also gives feedback on insufficient or
        nonworking services. <br>
        Monitoring system has two customers :
        (1) The business (2) Information Technology <br>
        The stages of a three-level maturity model reflecting
        monitoring evolution are :<br>
        <b>(i) Manual : </b> In this stage , monitoring is largely manual, user initiated,
        or not done at all.<br>
        <b>(ii) Reactive : </b> This type of monitoring is mostly automatic
        with some remnants of manual or unmonitored components.<br>
        <b>(iii) Proactive : </b>Here, monitoring is automatic and generated
        by configuration management. Example of different monitoring tools
        are Nagios, Sensu, and Graphite.<br/>

      <p>
      This chapter proposes an architecture for a monitoring framework.
      It also discusses the faults of traditional monitoring frameworks
      and compared the new architecture with it.
      The new architecture is based on "whitebox" or push based monitoring
      rather than a "blackbox" or pull based monitoring. In a white box or
      push based monitoring the components being monitored are queried. But
      in a "blackbox" or pull based monitoring the components being monitored
      send their data to a central collector. This kind of architecture
      is centered around collecting events,log and metrics. Metrics are
      properties of hardware and software. They are usually collected
      with as a value that occurred at a time stamp. These metrics can be
      transformed mathematically using sum, count, average, percentiles etc.
      If we have multiple sources, we may want to show aggregated result of
      the metrics across all the sources.
      A good visualization of data provides powerful analytics. It should
      clearly show the data without distorting it.

        Key design features for routing engine are as follows :
        <ul>
          <li> Receive events and metrics including scaling with growing
            environment. </li>
          <li>Maintain sufficient state to do event matching and provide
            context for notifications.</li>
          <li>Munge events including extracting metrics from events.</li>
          <li>Categorize and route data to be stored, graphed, alerted on,
            or sent to any other potential destinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>"If only I had the theorems! Then I should  nd the proofs
          easily enough."</b> -Bernard Riemann <br>
          Riemann is a monitoring tool that aggregates events from hosts
          and applications and can feed them into a stream processing
          language to be manipulated, summarized, or actioned. It can also
          track the state of incoming event and provides notifications.<br>
          A brief explanation on installing Riemann on three different hosts
          is given. Moreover, Configuring Riemann, Connecting Riemann servers,
          Alerting on the upstream Riemann servers, Testing, Validating,
          Performance, scaling, and making Riemann highly available
          is also explained in detail.
